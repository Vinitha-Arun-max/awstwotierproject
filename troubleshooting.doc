1.While run the DNS got error like site cant be reached ?

Solution :

1.Check ALB health check 
EC2-target group-web tg

==> while checking it shows unhealthy 2 , I have 2 EC2 both shows unhealthy 

==> checked port 80 and 22 was enabeled

==>Tried to connect EC2 but got error like "Error establishing connection between SSH" 

==> Checked if the public IP is configured or not 

==> Checked subnet under route table assocatian it is associated with VPC but not associated with IGW so added that one 


2) Now am able to conncet Ec2 but still the dns shows bad gateway ?

Reason: web server not installed ( curl http://localhost) 

==> while run this curl command it shows connection refused that means web server not installed 

Solution : 

==> Installed nginx by using below command 

i) sudo yum install nginx (that is also shows error and show below command to install)

ii)sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx

iii) sudo systemctl enable nginx

iv) sudo systemctl start nginx 

If i run the curl command now it shows some data 

Then tried with dns url it will work


3) I have already userdata and it contains httpd web server details ?

Reason : May be syntax issue 

Solution : Correct the syntax
